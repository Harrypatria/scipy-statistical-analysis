### scipy-statistical-analysis

- Scipy: Scipy is a Python library used for scientific and technical computing, including mathematics, science, and engineering. It provides many useful functions for optimization, signal processing, statistics, and more.

- Format Setting: This description is too vague to provide a clear answer, as there are many different contexts in which "format setting" could be used. Without further context, it is difficult to determine what this description is referring to.

- Statistical Analysis: This section of the tutorial aims to illustrate how to use Python to build statistical models and perform data analysis. It covers topics such as estimation, fitting data to probability distributions, and working with discrete and continuous random variables.

- Statistical Data Modeling: This section of the tutorial discusses the limitations of traditional statistical hypothesis testing and introduces a more powerful approach to statistical analysis that involves building flexible models to estimate quantities of interest. The tutorial provides examples of how to use Python to build statistical models from scratch and extract estimates and measures of uncertainty.
